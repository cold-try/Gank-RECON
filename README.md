## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Enumeration of subdomains from a domain name 
- Checking if a subdomain is takeoverable
- Checking if an inaccessible subdomain is bypassable via HTTP verb tampering or custom header
- Basic Auth bruteforce üÜï
- Search for secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords, etc.) in the subdomain and its javascript files üÜï
- Port scan
- Recording of results and notifications of changes between each execution of the program (new subdomain/open ports/HTTP code/secrets)
- Ergonomic listing of the different active subdomains sorted by HTTP code with the information related to them (open ports, vulnerabilities, changes)

> Possibility to customize certain parameters via the config.json file: personal word list (bruteforce), preferred ports, user-agent..

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

- Python 3 is required
- Chrome browser (or Chromium) is required
- Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment) :
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
If you are on a linux machine it may be necessary to install the libnss3 package :
```sh
sudo apt-get install libnss3
```

## üöÄ Launch

‚Ä¢ Before starting we need to get some API keys, this is not mandatory but highly recommended to maximize our results.

| Service | Website | Is it free? |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Binary Edge | https://www.binaryedge.io | yes
| Security Trails | https://securitytrails.com | yes
| Censys | https://censys.io | yes
| VirusTotal | https://www.virustotal.com | yes
| AlienVault | https://otx.alienvault.com | yes
| Bevigil | https://bevigil.com | yes
| Intelligence X | https://intelx.io | yes

Go to the config.json file and enter your API keys there (*Most APIs are free but limited*).

‚Ä¢ You can modify the values contained in the config.json file: the user agent, the number of threads, the lists used for the bruteforce or modify the port lists by your preferred ports.

‚Ä¢ To start the program, go to the root of the directory and run the command : 
```sh
python3 core.py
```

Some regex used to find secrets come from the very good repository: GitGraber
